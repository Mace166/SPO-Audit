# SPO-Audit app
A User Interface (UI) design using Adobe XD for a Fabric UI/React Projects app based on SharePoint Online.

### Concept
To design a Sharepoint Online Audit creation SPFX application.

### Requirements
The app design will be created using Adobe UD and the Fabric UI toolkit.

The app must be intuitive and easy to use without training.

As the app would be inserted into a SharePoint Online Modern Experience site page zone using a 100% single-column width.

The design must include the end-user functionality and how to edit the app from the side property pane.

The app should show the SharePoint online site theme colors fit into the existing styling of the page.

While the app itself will not be built as part of this project, the design must support an app created with React.

### Design Notes

The end result would include an example of the design with a selection of different coloured themes.

The design will incorporate Sharepoint Online into its end-user functionality to demonstrate how it would look on a Modern Experience Team Site.
